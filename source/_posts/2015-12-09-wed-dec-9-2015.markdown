I miss writing these short little journal entries that summarize the day.
They help me keep things in perspective and organized---be more efficient. 

This has been a challenging semester. We've spent quite a bit of time
discussing and reflecting upon the LIS curriculum. This discussion is still
unfinished but good changes are coming.

I've been working on too many projects. Things need to simplify and I need
to work alone for a bit. I'm at my best when I work at a pace that I define
for myself. That said, there are still some collaborations that I'm enjoying
and would like to see through.

Didn't post the above before leaving work yesterday. It's now 2015/12/10.
Agenda for the day:

1. Edit/write on two papers
2. Edit/write grant proposal
3. Create one more video tutorial for LIS 621
4. Grade, time permitting
