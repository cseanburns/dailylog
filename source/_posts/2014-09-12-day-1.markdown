The start of a near daily journal.

I spent today primarily doing administrative and service work, it seems. This
included attending and reporting at a faculty meeting, reviewing two submissions
to the sigmet workshop, meeting with several colleagues, and completing various
tasks for my courses.

I received some sample data for the ecology project and was able to review that
for the Monday meeting.

I'm continuing to tease out some details of my megajournal project. The analysis
is almost complete and I should finish the writing very soon.
