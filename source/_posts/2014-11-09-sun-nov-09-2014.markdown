Spent the last few days attending the joint History of Science Society and
Philosophy of Science Society annual conference in Chicago. It was a smart
conference and there is quite a bit of overlap between scholarly communication,
as practiced in the library and information science field, and the history and
philosophy of science. Attended talks on:

* history of the history of science
* Einstein
* bounded rationality
* peer review
* student examinations
* open access
* thought experiments
* and more.

I've attended humanities conferences before so the experience wasn't quite
foreign, but since I study scholarly communication, I found the experience
worthwhile for that alone.

The open access discussion confirmed my opinion that OA advocates need to
evangelize less and reach out to all stakeholders in the scholarly communication
system. That is, it's a complicated topic, with concerned, rational, and
well-intentioned people on all sides (authors, higher education administrators,
society members, society publishers, other scholarly publishers, editors, as
well as librarians, etc.), and needs to be treated so and not reduced to
platitudes.
