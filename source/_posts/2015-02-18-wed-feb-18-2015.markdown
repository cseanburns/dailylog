Weather has really caused a lot of pain this week. University was closed
on Monday and Tuesday. Opened today on Wednesday, but we were just notified
that it will be closed on the next couple of days. Snowstorms! Argh!

Anyway, got a lot of instructional work done these last few days, including
grading and lecture writing.
