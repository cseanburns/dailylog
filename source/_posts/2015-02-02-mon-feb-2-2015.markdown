Last week I attended a conference, and it was good.

Today was spent catching up with emails and doing more in-depth instruction.
I'm using Canvas now, which has this nice ability to not just subscribe to
discussion forums and receive individual posts via email, but also to reply
to individual posts via email. I like this because I email with [mutt][1]
and [vim][2] and I'm pretty fast (all keyboard driven) can contribute and
respond quickly and thoroughly.
