Good hallway conversations with colleagues today. Started to discuss a big
project.

Got more exploratory work done on a new project (text mining), and had a nice
email discussion with a colleague / collaborator about the project. Meeting with
collaborator next week.

Graded a lot of student work. A lot more grading next week.
