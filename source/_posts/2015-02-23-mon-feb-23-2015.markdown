Rough week last week. We had a couple big snowstorms and campus was shutdown
most of last week as a result. Was able to work from home and do a lot of
instructional work (online courses) and some writing.

Today's return to campus was a bit too much. Lots of activities. Still, was
able to do some instructional work. I have a good day planned tomorrow.
