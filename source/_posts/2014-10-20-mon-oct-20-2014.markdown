Primarily worked on courses this morning and reviewed conference papers in the
afternoon. Also attended the opening presentation for OA Week (webcast but
locally presented with the help of UK Libraries), responded to emails (lots of
advisee work today -- and more later this week), read and commented on drafts
for a grant proposal, and a few other small tasks.
